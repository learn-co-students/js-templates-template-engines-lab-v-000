JavaScript lodash Templates Lab
---

## Objectives

1. Practice using JavaScript templates for a simple blog
2. Practice modularizing code and templates
3. Practice separating view and logic concerns

## Introduction

In this lab, we're going to be using lodash templates to create a simple
blog site with posts and comments. We want to use templates to
modularize the page and dynamically load new elements.

Don't forget to run the tests and make sure everything works!

## Instructions

1. Create a template with an id of `page-template` that will represent
   the page of a blog post, including a `sidebar` element and a `post`
element that will hold our blog post.
2. Create a `post-template` that will represent
   the blog post itself. It should have a `header` for the post title
and a `footer` for the post author, and be wrapped in an `article`
element.
3. Create a `comments-template` that will be the container for the
   collection of comments on the blog post, as well as the comment form.
4. Create a `comment-template` that will hold an individual comment.
   Should have a `footer` for the commenter name.
5. Provide a form with an id of `post-form` to create a blog post with a title, body, and author. Submitting the form should
   build the page template with the post inside. It's okay if the form
goes away after you make your blog post! Make the form submit using a
`createPost()` function.
6. Provide a form within the `comments-template` to post comments, including commenter name and comment
   text. These should use the template to
   insert individual comments into the comments section. You should be
able to keep adding more comments. Make the form submit use a
`postComment()` function.
