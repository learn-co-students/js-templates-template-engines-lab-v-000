# JavaScript Lodash Templates Lab

[x]  Create a template with an id of `page-template` that will represent the page
    of a blog post, including a `sidebar` element and a `post` element that will
    hold our blog post.

[x]  Create a `post-template` that will represent the blog post itself. It should
    have a `header` for the post title and a `footer` for the post author, and be
    wrapped in an `article` element.

[x]  Create a `comments-template` that will be the container for the collection
    of comments on the blog post, as well as the comment form.

[x]  Create a `comment-template` that will hold an individual comment. Should
    have a `footer` for the commenter name.

[x]  Provide a form with an id of `post-form` to create a blog post with a title,
    body, and author. Submitting the form should build the page template with the
    post inside. Make the form submit using a `createPost()` function.

[x]  Provide a form within the `comments-template` to post comments, including
    commenter name and comment text. These should use the template to insert
    individual comments into the comments section. You should be able to keep adding more comments. Make the form submit use a `postComment()` function.
